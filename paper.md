# Summary

In recent years, the increasing concern over air quality and its impact on public health has led to the widespread deployment of geotagged particulate matter (PM) sensors. These sensors provide valuable real-time data on the concentration and distribution of particulate matter in different geographical locations. However, the effective utilization of this data requires a robust data visualization tool that can transform complex sensor readings into insightful visual representations. This statement of need outlines the necessity and significance of developing a specialized data visualization tool for geotagged particulate matter sensors.
